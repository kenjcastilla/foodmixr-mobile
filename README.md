# Inspiration
Imagine you're sitting in a restaurant, and you hear a song playing faintly through the speakers. You soon realize that this might be one 
of the best songs you've heard in a long time. You open your phone and use an app that captures audio, processes it, and returns the song information.
Unfortunately, the attempt fails, as (a) there is too much noise in the restaurant or (b) the song ended before you could capture the audio. 
You hang your head in defeat, accepting that you may never hear that song again.

*ENTER FOODMIXR*

Foodmixr is an application that allows customers or otherwise to see what song is being played at a given establishment without the need for audio capture. All the establishment has to do is sign up with Foodmixr Web, and then clients with the Foodmixr Mobile application can see what is being played in real time. The struggle to find out what beauty is being played
behind all of that commotion ends here.
